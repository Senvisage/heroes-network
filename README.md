# Heroes Network

_This website is meant (at least for now) for pedagogic purposes, and shouldn't be used outside this specific scope._

## What ? Why ?

This site will cater to specific needs expressed by pen-and-paper RPG players. It will allow them to gather their characters and stories in one place, to make sure no more character sheet are ever lost in the wilds !

More specifically, it aims at :

- helping players to register their characters, separating their description (history, physical, behaviour, personnality, relationships, etc) from their actual character sheets.
- helping masters to create full-fleshed NPC characters on-the-fly : any character created here may be used as an NPC by anybody.
- helping masters to organize RPG nights, by contacting fellow players at once and creating a space where they can speak together about their latest adventures.

... And so much more, of course, yours truly is over-optimistic about what can be done with this kind of project !

## Let's get technical !

As said at the top, this project is only a learning tool, and the author doesn't know if it will ever reach a maturity stage where it can be broadly used (if you're wondering : he hopes it will ! ;-) )

To install this project at home, you should use these commands :

```
cd front-react
npm install
cd ../back
npm install
```
